  M2 - Assign DID and VCs to AI
========================================================================================

[ORIGINAL SPEC] OUTPUTS
Open source GitHub repo containing all code and APIs to:
 - assign DID to a virtualised AI (the AI is running in docker and accessible via openseourceais.com) 
 - create a Verified Credential for this AI
 - get general information and stats from this AI, in the form of a JSON format

[ORIGINAL SPEC] ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
 - The AI is assigned a DID
 - The AI has one or multiple Verified Credentials
 - Additional milestone 1 outcomes are satisfied

M2 - NEW PLAN AFTER M1 DESIGN review
    * wrap Identus APIs for our needs in a separate open source "identity" nodeJS app (will likely host it on identity.opensourceais.com)
    * make OSAIS as admin + issuer & verifier of VCs of this identity platform
    * identity open source APIs to issue wallets (to AI, to Caller, to service provider)
    * identity open source APIs to issue DID (to AI, to Caller, to service provider)
    * identity open source APIs to issue VC (to AI, Caller, service provider)
    * OSAIS to decompose an AI's attribute to resurface service providers (of GPU, of models, etc...) [this part is not open source, as part of OSAIS internals]
    * OSAIS to display in UI the status of an AI from its VCs (identity, performance, cost) [I will likely make all open source until getting a JSON, then the UI may be private, to be reviewed]

========================================================================================
  Tasks done during this milestone [May/June 2024]
========================================================================================

 - implemented a test Node Identus on latest release (v1.33.0)
 - built the open source framework of the Identity Agent (NodeJS app) that connects Identus to OSAIS
 - implentation of the Identity Agent:
   * APIs to manage wallet, entities and DIDs
   * added ability to register an entity (caller, worker, provider, admin) and assign a DID + create an Identity wallet + create entity's authentication keys into Identus
   * a wallet can have several entities (one per type), and each entity has one separate authentication key + one DID
   * APIs to upload and register Schemas
   * APIs to create VC definitions
   * APIs to create private connections between 2 DIDs (invite, accept)
   * APIs to issue Verifiable Credentials (offer, accept, issue)
   * APIs to request presentation of Proof of Claims (request, accept, provide claim)

 - within OSAIS:
   * implemented assigning a DID (caller) to any registered actor in the ecosystem
   * registering OSAIS itself as admin 
   * all registered users receive a Caller DID
   * all registered Virtual AIs receive a Caller DID and a Worker DID
   * some basic AI DID-schemas are created at startup (in the Identity agent and in Identus)
   * AIs receive a Identity Credential at creation 
   * OSAIS can request AIs to show proof of Identity, and receive a VC proof with identity claims inside
