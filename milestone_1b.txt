  M1 - Finalise the specifications and choice of Tech Stacks
========================================================================================

OUTPUTS
 - This is a Concept proposal, with many risks of implementation. At this early stage, we feel the need for a small initial milestone to establish clearly all the specifications and tech stacks.
 - The output produced at this milestone: 
        * A public GitHub repo
        * A few video proof of some tech validation / Proof of concepts supporting the choice of the future tech stack
        * Documented choice of tech stacks for the upcoming milestones
        * Defined specifications for each component (NFT metadata, DID, VC content, etc…)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
        * we have a workable design and choice of tech to deliver this PoC
        * we have identified risks, limitations, challenges…
        * we are in a position to implement the next phases

  Tasks done during this milestone [April 2024]
========================================================================================

 - the work during March was mostly spent on DID/PRISM to validate how the Verified Credentials (VC) could be used
 - it was demonstrated that we will be able to use DIDs and VCs, although we ran into a small bug for the final VC issuance
 - worked through a solution to the "bug" of last month, and finally was able to get a working env
 - HOLDER can now accept a Credential Offer
 - ISSUER can now issue the final Verifiable Credential
 - VERIFIER can verify a credential by establishing a one to one private conenction with a HOLDER
 - Full end to end validation of PRISM / Identus done, from setup to VC verification
 - Assessed additional capabilities / requirements (AnonCreds, Trust Registry) 
 - Defined the architecture we will implement for this PoC (heavy use of DIDs/VC, no use of Smart contract, Prep OSAIS for future increased decentralisation and DAPP)
 - Defined entities in the eco-system (AI workers, callers, and service providers)
 - Defined the final specs of the VCs for all entities in the eco-system
 - Produced video report (https://youtu.be/u_ufSn_7UR8) covering all aspects (PRISM tests, Architecture review, New Design, Proposal for changes)
