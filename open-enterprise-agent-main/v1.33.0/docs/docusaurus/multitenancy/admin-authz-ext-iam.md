# Admin Authorization with External IAM

In the past tutorials, the administrator utilized a static API key for authentication and authorization.
The Agent also features a more sophisticated role-based authorization mechanism using external IAM,
allowing users to be authorized under different roles and granting access to parts of the Agent.

## Roles

For the Agent admin authorization, we need to distinguish the administrator of each component:

1. [Agent Administrator](/docs/concepts/glossary#administrator)
2. Keycloak Administrator

The same person may also represent these roles.

## Prerequisites

1. Keycloak is up and running
2. Keycloak is configured as follows
   1. A realm called `my-realm` is created
   2. A client called `cloud-agent` under `my-realm` with __authorization__ feature is created. (See [create client instruction](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_resource_server_create_client))
   3. Make sure the `cloud-agent` client has __direct access grants__ enabled to simplify the login
3. The Cloud Agent is up and running
4. The Cloud Agent is configured with the following environment variables:
   1. `KEYCLOAK_ENABLED=true`
   2. `KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:9980` (replace with appropriate value)
   3. `KEYCLOAK_REALM=my-realm`
   4. `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=cloud-agent`
   5. `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=<KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET>` (replace with appropriate value)
   6. `KEYCLOAL_ROLES_CLAIM_PATH=resource_access.cloud-agent.roles`

## Overview

This tutorial will guide you through the steps to configure roles in Keycloak and
demonstrate the authorization process as an administrator within the agent,
enabling you to perform various administrative tasks.

Once authorized as an admin, the user gains the ability to manage the wallet;
however, the actual utilization of the wallet remains restricted.
Despite UMA permissions configured for the user, the agent strictly maintains a clear segregation of roles between administrator and tenant.

## Endpoints

### Agent endpoints
| Endpoint       | Description                         | Role          |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| `GET /wallets` | List the wallets on the Cloud Agent | Administrator |

### Keycloak endpoints
| Endpoint                                             | Description           | Role          |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| `POST /realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token` | Issue a new JWT token | Administrator |

## Keycloak Administrator interactions

### 1. Configure Keycloak role on the client

Open the Keycloak admin UI in the browser and navigate to `my-realm` in the admin UI.
Choose the corresponding client to create a `ClientRole`.
Choose __Role__ tab in the client menu and create a new role called `admin`

### 2. Assign the `admin` role to the user

Once the role gets created, the admin user should be assigned this role.
For simplicity, we will assign the role to the user without managing any group or other metadata.

Navigate to __Users__ menu on the sidebar in the admin UI.
Click on the user that should have the `admin` role.
Choose __Role Mapping__ tab and click __Assign Role__.
Choose __Filter by clients__ in the dropdown menu. Then choose the `admin` role.

Fore more info on role mapping see the [Keycloak official documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#proc-assigning-role-mappings_server_administration_guide).
If a user does not exist, a new user can be created by following this [Keycloak official guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#proc-creating-user_server_administration_guide).

After this step, the user should have the `admin` role assigned, and after they log in, the `roles` claim should appear in the JWT payload.

## Agent Administrator interactions

### 1. Obtain an access token from Keycloak

The admin user can log in using any configured authorization flow in Keycloak.
In this example, the __direct access grant__ is used to login.

Run the command to log in as admin.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:9980/realms/my-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=admin-cli" \
  -d "username=alice" \
  -d "password=1234"
```

Example token response (some fields omitted for readability)

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...7ocDHofUDQ",
    "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOi...otsEEi4eQA",
    ...
}
```

Inspecting the `access_token` payload, it should have the following content

```json
{
  "resource_access": {
    "cloud-agent": {
      "roles": [
        "admin"
      ]
    },
    "account": {
      "roles": [
        "manage-account",
        "manage-account-links",
        "view-profile"
      ]
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

### 2. Perform a simple action to verify admin rights on the Agent

To prove that the admin can perform admin tasks,
try listing all the tenants' wallets using the JWT in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/cloud-agent/wallets' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...e7H6W8RUvA' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

The response should return a list of all wallets on the Agent with HTTP status 200.
Trying to perform prohibited tenant interactions, such as listing the DIDs in the wallet, will result in an authorization error.
