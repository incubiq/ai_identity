# Tenant Onboarding with External IAM

In the [Tenant Onboarding](./tenant-onboarding.md) tutorial, we explored the basic [IAM](/docs/concepts/glossary#iam) functionality out of the box.
Although it is usable and straightforward, more featureful tools are available for handling identity and access management.
The agent can seamlessly connect with [Keycloak](/docs/concepts/glossary#keycloak-service) as an external IAM system, allowing the application built on top to utilize the capabilities that come with Keycloak.

The Cloud Agent leverages standard protocols like [OIDC](/docs/concepts/glossary#oidc) and [UMA](/docs/concepts/glossary#uma) for authentication and access management.
The user's identity gets established through the ID token, and wallet permissions are searchable using the [RPT (requesting party token)](/docs/concepts/glossary#rpt).

## Roles

In tenant management with external IAM, there are 2 roles:

1. [Administrator](/docs/concepts/glossary#administrator)
2. [Tenant](/docs/concepts/glossary#tenant)

## Prerequisites

1. Keycloak up and running
2. Keycloak is configured as follows
   1. A realm called `my-realm` is created
   2. A client called `cloud-agent` under `my-realm` with __authorization__ feature is created. (See [create client instruction](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_resource_server_create_client))
   3. Make sure the `cloud-agent` client has __direct access grants__ enabled to simplify the login process for this tutorial
3. the Cloud Agent is up and running
4. the Cloud Agent is configured with the following environment variables:
   1. `ADMIN_TOKEN=my-admin-token`
   2. `DEFAULT_WALLET_ENABLED=false`
   3. `KEYCLOAK_ENABLED=true`
   4. `KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:9980` (replace with appropriate value)
   5. `KEYCLOAK_REALM=my-realm`
   6. `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=cloud-agent`
   7. `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=<KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET>` (replace with appropriate value)
   8. `KEYCLOAK_UMA_AUTO_UPGRADE_RPT=false`

## Overview

This tutorial illustrates the process of provisioning a wallet resource for the new tenant and creating a tenant in Keycloak.
The administrator can then create a UMA permission for the wallet, giving access to the tenant.

When setting up UMA permissions on the agent, the wallet resource, along with the UMA policy and permission
are created on Keycloak according to a predefined convention.
For flexibility in defining custom policy and permission models,
administrators can manually create these UMA resources (resource, policy, permission) directly on Keycloak
using a set of UMA endpoints called [Protection API](/docs/concepts/glossary#protection-api)  (see [Keycloak Protection API](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_service_protection_api)).
However, using Protection API to manage permissions is out of the scope of this tutorial.

Once the registration is successful, the tenant can obtain an ID token from Keycloak using any available OIDC flow,
such as the direct access grants (username & password). This ID token typically contains user claims such as username and subject ID.
The tenant can use Keycloak's token endpoint to convert this token to an RPT (requesting party token),
another token containing permissions information.
The tenant can access the multi-tenant agent by providing the RPT in the `Authorization` header.

## Administrator interactions

### 1. Check the existing wallets

When running Cloud Agent using the configurations above, the Cloud Agent should start with an empty state.
Listing wallets on it should return empty results.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8080/cloud-agent/wallets' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-admin-api-key: my-admin-token'
```

Response Example:

```json
{
  "self": "/wallets",
  "kind": "WalletPage",
  "pageOf": "/wallets",
  "contents": []
}
```

### 2. Create a new wallet

Create a wallet using a `POST /wallets` endpoint.
This wallet will be a container for the tenant's assets (DIDs, VCs, Connections, etc.).
Provide a wallet seed during the wallet creation or let the Agent generate one


```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/cloud-agent/wallets' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-admin-api-key: my-admin-token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "seed": "c9994785ce6d548134020f610b76102ca1075d3bb672a75ec8c9a27a7b8607e3b9b384e43b77bb08f8d5159651ae38b98573f7ecc79f2d7e1f1cc371ce60cf8a",
    "name": "my-wallet"
  }'
```

Response Example:

```json
{
  "id": "99734c87-5c9d-4697-b5fd-dea4e9590ba7",
  "name": "my-wallet",
  "createdAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### 3. User registration on Keycloak

There are multiple ways to complete this step.
The goal is to ensure the user has registered on Keycloak.
Keycloak offers great flexibility, allowing users to self-register,
For this tutorial, we will generate the user manually using Keycloak admin API for simplicity.

The first step is to get an admin token from Keycloak using the username and password.
This token allows the admin to perform operations on Keycloak, such as creating a new user.
Running the provided command should return the admin access token.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:9980/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=admin-cli" \
  -d "username=$KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER" \
  -d "password=$KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
```

Make sure to replace the Keycloak variables with appropriate values.

Example token response (some fields omitted for readability)

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...7ocDHofUDQ",
    "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOi...otsEEi4eQA",
    ...
}
```

After obtaining the `access_token` from Keycloak's admin, a new user can be created using this command:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:9980/admin/realms/my-realm/users' \
  -v \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...7ocDHofUDQ' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw "{
    \"username\": \"alice\",
    \"firstName\": \"Alice\",
    \"enabled\": true,
    \"credentials\": [{\"value\": \"1234\", \"temporary\": false}]
  }"
```

Make sure to use the correct `access_token` in the `Authorization` header from the previous command.

Example response log

```log
< HTTP/1.1 201 Created
< Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
< X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
< Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
< X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
< Location: http://localhost:9980/admin/realms/my-realm/users/205e04b7-0158-41b0-89c3-f91c3a09f89b
< content-length: 0
```

The response should return status `201 Created` indicating the new user is registerd with username `alice` with a password `1234`.
The user ID can be observed from `Location` header of the response. This ID will be used for creating permission later in this tutorial.

For in-depth user management, please consult the official Keycloaak administration documentation on [managing users section](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#assembly-managing-users_server_administration_guide).

### 4. Grant the user permission to the wallet

Once the user and wallet have been successfully created, the permissions can be created giving the user access to the wallet.
This can be done by invoking the `POST /wallets/{walletId}/uma-permissions` endpoint on the agent.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/cloud-agent/wallets/99734c87-5c9d-4697-b5fd-dea4e9590ba7/uma-permissions' \
  -v \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'x-admin-api-key: my-admin-token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "subject": "205e04b7-0158-41b0-89c3-f91c3a09f89b"
  }'
```

Make sure to use the correct `subject` for the user and the correct `walletId` from the step earlier.
The user ID can be observed from the response header from the previous step or in the __User__ menu in Keycloak Admin UI.

The response should return status `200 OK` in case of successful permission creation.

## Tenant interactions

After the user is registered on Keycloak and the required permission is created by admin,
the tenant can log in and utilize the agent by using the token issued by Keycloak.

### 1. Obtain access token from Keycloak

The first step is to authenticate via Keycloak through any applicable authentication method.
Usually, the tenant will use some frontend application that follows the standard flow for logging in.
For simplicity, we use a flow for username and password in this tutorial.
The administrator has already set up the username and password for the tenant.
To get the access token, the tenant can call the Keycloak token endpoint directly with those credentials.

Run the command to log in

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:9980/realms/my-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=admin-cli" \
  -d "username=alice" \
  -d "password=1234"
```

Special attention on the `client_id`; this should be the actual `client_id` of the frontend application that logs the user in.
For this tutorial, it is OK to use `admin-cli`.

Example token response (some fields omitted for readability)

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...7ocDHofUDQ",
    "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOi...otsEEi4eQA",
    ...
}
```

### 2. Request [RPT (requesting party token)](/docs/concepts/glossary#rpt) from access token

After the access token is acquired, the next step is to get the RPT token, which holds information about the permissions.
It is possible to request the RPT by running this command:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://localhost:9980/realms/my-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...7ocDHofUDQ" \
  -d "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:uma-ticket" \
  -d "audience=cloud-agent"
```

Example token response (some fields omitted for readability)

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...e7H6W8RUvA",
    "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOi...W1_y1AF_YY",
    ...
}
```

After inspecting the response token, a new claim named `authorization` should appear in the JWT payload.

Example RPT payload (some fields omitted for readability)

```json
{
  ...
  "authorization": {
    "permissions": [
      {
        "rsid": "99734c87-5c9d-4697-b5fd-dea4e9590ba7",
        "rsname": "<WALLET_RESOURCE_NAME>"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
}
```

### 3. Perform a simple action to verify access to the Cloud Agent

To prove that the tenant can access the wallet using RPT,
try listing the DIDs in the wallet using RPT in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/cloud-agent/did-registrar/dids' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...e7H6W8RUvA' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

Make sure to replace the token with RPT from previous step.

The result should show 200 status with an empty list.
This means that the wallet has been created and does not contain any DIDs.
All actions carried out by the tenant must be limited to this specific wallet.

### A note on RPT

In this tutorial, there is an additional step for the tenant to request the RPT from the access token.
This process aligns with the standard UMA interaction, where the handling of RPT typically occurs on the client side.
To simplify the experience, the agent has a feature allowing users to bypass this process.
By setting the variable `KEYCLOAK_UMA_AUTO_UPGRADE_RPT=true`, tenants can utilize the access token
obtained in step 1 directly in the `Authorization` header, eliminating the need for additional RPT request step.
