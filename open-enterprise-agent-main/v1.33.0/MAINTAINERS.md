## The Duties of a Maintainer

The expectation is for maintainers to perform the following duties for this repository. The responsibilities listed are in high to low-priority order:

- Review, respond, and act on any security vulnerabilities reported against the repository.
- Review, provide feedback on, and merge or reject GitHub Pull Requests from
  Contributors.
- Review, triage, comment on, and close GitHub Issues
  submitted by Contributors.
- When appropriate, lead/facilitate architectural discussions in the community.
- When appropriate, lead/facilitate the creation of a product roadmap.
- Create, clarify, and label issues to be worked on by Contributors.
- Ensure that there is a well-defined (and ideally automated) product test and
  release pipeline, including the publication of release artifacts.
- When appropriate, execute the product release process.
- Maintain the repository CONTRIBUTING.md file and getting started documents to
  give guidance and encouragement to those wanting to contribute to the product and become maintainers.
- Contribute to the product via GitHub Pull Requests.
- Monitor requests from the Hyperledger Technical Oversight Committee about the
contents and management of Hyperledger repositories, such as branch handling,
required files in repositories, etc.
- Contribute to the Hyperledger Project's Quarterly Report.

## Becoming a Maintainer

This community welcomes contributions. Interested contributors are encouraged to
progress to become maintainers. To become a maintainer, the following steps
occur roughly in order.

- The proposed maintainer establishes their reputation in the community,
  including authoring five (5) significant merged pull requests, and expresses
  an interest in becoming a maintainer for the repository.
A PR has been created to update this file and add the proposed maintainer to the list of active maintainers.
- An existing maintainer authors the PR or has a comment on the PR from an existing maintainer supporting the proposal.
- The proposed maintainer authors the PR or has a comment from the proposed maintainer confirming their interest in being a maintainer.
  - The PR or comment from the proposed maintainer must include their
    willingness to be a long-term (more than 6 months) maintainer.
- An approval timeframe begins once the PR and necessary comments are received.
- The PR **MUST** be communicated on all appropriate channels, including relevant community calls, chat channels, and mailing lists. The community's comments of support are welcome.
- The PR gets merged, and the proposed maintainer becomes a maintainer if either:
 - Two weeks have passed since the receipt of at least three (3) Maintainer PR approvals, OR
  - An absolute majority of maintainers have approved the PR.
- It may be closed if the PR does not get the requisite PR approvals.
- Once the add maintainer PR merges, any updates to the GitHub Teams are made.

## Removing Maintainers

Being a maintainer is not a status symbol or a title or indefinite. 
Moving the maintainer to emeritus status will occasionally be necessary and appropriate.
The status change can occur in the following situations:

- Resignation of a maintainer.
- Violation of the Code of Conduct warranting removal.
- Inactivity.
  - A general measure of inactivity will be no commits or code review comments
    for one reporting quarter. Inactivity will not be strictly enforced if
    the maintainer expresses a reasonable intent to continue contributing.
  - Reasonable exceptions to inactivity will be granted for known long-term
    leave such as parental leave and medical leave.
- Other circumstances are at the discretion of the other maintainers.

The process to move a maintainer from active to emeritus status is comparable to the process for adding a maintainer, outlined above. In the case of voluntary
resignation, the Pull Request is mergeable following a maintainer PR approval. If the removal is for any other reason, the following steps **SHOULD** be followed:

- A PR has been created to update this file and move the maintainer to the list of emeritus maintainers.
- The PR is authored by or has a comment supporting the proposal from an existing maintainer or Hyperledger GitHub organization administrator.
- The approval timeframe begins upon receipt of the PR and necessary comments.
- The PR **MAY** be communicated on appropriate channels, including relevant community calls, chat channels, and mailing lists.
- The PR gets merged, and the maintainer transitions to maintainer emeritus if: 
  - The PR gets approval from the maintainer to transition, OR 
  - Two weeks have passed since receipt of at least three (3) Maintainer PR approvals, OR 
  - An absolute majority of maintainers have approved the PR.
- It may be closed if the PR does not get the requisite PR approvals.

Returning to active status from emeritus status uses the same steps as adding a
new maintainer. Note that the emeritus maintainer already has the 5 required
significant changes, as there is no contribution time horizon for those.
