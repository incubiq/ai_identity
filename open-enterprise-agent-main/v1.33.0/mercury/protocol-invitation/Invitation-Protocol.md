# Invitation Protocol

This Protocol is parte of the **DIDComm Messaging Specification** but also **Aries RFC 0434: Out-of-Band Protocol 1.1**

Its a out-of-band style protocol.

The out-of-band protocol is used when you wish to engage with another agent and you don't have a DIDComm connection to use for the interaction.
