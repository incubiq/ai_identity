# Access Control

**Status**: draft

**Date**: 2021-06-02

**NOTE**: this document is a draft and is not implemented yet. Statement in this document might be changed in the future.

## Introduction

Current document describes the levels of access control in the Identus Platform configured in the Vault service
The Vault service uses policies to control the access to the secrets, configuration, and other resources.
The policies are applied to the entities and groups of entities.

According to the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), the access to the resources must be granted to the entities with the minimal set of permissions required to perform the operation.

## Accounts

### SUDO Account

The account with `sudo` privileges that allows to configure the Vault service.
The root token is used for this purpose.
The root token must be kept in the most safe place and not used for regular cases.

SUDO Account is used for the following purposes:
- configure the Vault service
- configure authentication methods
- configure Management Accounts

Managed by DevOps and SRE teams.

### Management Account

Management Account is special account that allows to manage the Cloud Agent.

The account with the limited access to configure the Vault service with the following permissions:
- manage the Wallet accounts
- manage the Agent accounts
- enforces the policies to the Wallet account

Management Account can be used in the configuration scripts or by the SRE team.

### Agent Account

Agent Account is created for the Cloud Agent to authenticate itself to the Vault service.
AppRole authentication method is used for this account.

The account with the limited access to configure the Vault service with the following permissions:
- create the Wallet accounts
- issue the token to the Wallet account
- do other operations required to configure the Wallet account

### Wallet Account

The Wallet Account is created for and used by the Wallet.
The Wallet Account is has access to the secrets of the Wallet and the Cloud Agent must guarantee the data isolation at the Wallet level.
This account has the following permissions:
- list, read, write, delete the secrets associated with the Wallet
- use the REST API associated with the Wallet
- manage the data associated with the Wallet

## Technical Overview

### Principle of Least Privilege

The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is a security concept that requires that a user is granted no more privilege than necessary to perform a task.
The following practices are applied to implement the PoLP:
- audit: all the credentials are audited and must be under control of the SRE team
- administrator and business accounts are separated
- activity monitoring: activity of the administrator accounts is monitored
- just-in-time access: the access to the resources is granted only for the time required to perform the operation

**NOTE**: there are other PoLP practices that are not covered in this document. These practices will be ignored for local development and testing purposes.

In order to implement the PoLP, the following access control rules are defined:
- the Cloud Agent account has access to the Wallet account that belong to the Agent only
- the Cloud Agent account transparently issues the token to the Wallet account based on configured authentication method

### Token Issuing, Renewal, Expiration and Revocation

These policies are applied to all tokens except the SUDO account (root token).

All tokens issued by the Identus Platform have the following properties:
- expiration time
- maximum time to live (TTL)
- renewable flag
- orphan flag
- policies
- operation limitations (number of the requests that can be performed by the token)

Management account token policies:
- authentication methods: GitHub, GoogleAuth, user/password
- expiration time: 1 hour

Agent Account token policies:
- authentication method: AppRole
- token expiration time: 24 hour

Wallet Account token policies:
- authentication methods: JWT, token issued by the Agent account, user/password
- token expiration time: 1 hour

**NOTE**: user/password method is used for the development and testing purposes only.
