# Linting

Megalinter is the default linter and runs at the point of creating a Pull Request (PR) by GitHub Actions. It gets included as a pre-commit hook.

## Configuration

The default configuration for Megalinter is at the repository's root in `.mega-linter.yml`.

This configuration forms the base. To override additional properties, do so in the GitHub Action workflow file `./github/workflows/lint.yml`.

The GitHub Action workflow file only impacts the configuration when it runs within the continuous integration (CI) environment.

Megalinter's behavior will differ when run locally as part of the pre-commit hook [or enacted manually] compared to when run in an automated way in Github Actions as part of CI.

> **Note:** Linting is currently in an early adoption phase and due to the adoption of Scala 3, it only runs in a mode that does not fail PR checks.

> **Note:** At the end of this markdown document is a section for the changelog. Please leave feedback in this section so that we can enable and refine the linting configuration over time

## Linting Feedback

Please add any changes to the linting rules in the below changelog section. It will allow us to capture changes to linters over time, allowing us to understand the good and the bad concerning linting.

This feedback aims to strike the balance of linting helping improve quality but not at the cost of developer velocity.

The initial configuration disables linters which were previously disabled and then changing linters which seem incompatible with our current work to "Enabled but pass even with error"

Please use the following format:

#### SQL_SQL_LINT_ARGUMENTS

Author: Pat Losoponkul

Date Actioned: 2023-01-18

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change:  Customise

*Change detail*

`sql-lint` postgres ALTER grammar is still quite limited as observed
in [postgres alter grammar](https://github.com/joereynolds/sql-lint/blob/0908c5b19e5275be9de339e2d26d3057526687f1/src/lexer/statements/postgres/alter.ts#L8).
Suggest we ignore this check for now as we use some ALTER TYPE in migration script.

```yaml
SQL_SQL_LINT_ARGUMENTS: -d postgres --ignore-errors=postgres-invalid-alter-option
```

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Add option `postgres-invalid-create-option` to the linter argument due to linter not
recognizing CREATE POLICY statement that is used in RLS

Author: Pat Losoponkul

Date Actioned: 2023-01-18

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change:  Disable

*Change detail*

As we use Postgres as our main database, this linter should be configured to skip `.sql` files
intended for postgres or disabled entirely if we are not using T-SQL.

#### SCALA_SCALAFIX

Date Added: 2023-01-16

Author: David Poltorak

Date Actioned: 2023-01-16

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change: Disabled

*Change detail*

SCALA_SCALAFIX is not compatible with Scala3. The errors it reports cannot be fixed. Suggest that we disable this and rely on scalafmt only

#### MARKDOWN_MARKDOWN_LINK_CHECK

Date Added: 2023-01-16

Author: David Poltorak

Date Actioned: 2023-01-16

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change: Customise and Enabled but pass even with error

*Change detail*

MARKDOWN_MARKDOWN_LINK_CHECK detects lots of broken links in automatically generated files. Suggest change configuration to ignore `CHANGELOG.md` which don't conform to the rules.

MARKDOWN_MARKDOWN_LINK_CHECK cannot traverse links to websites which require authentication. This means that links to protected github pages fail checks. Suggest change to configuration to enable but pass even with error until repository is public.

#### PROTOBUF_PROTOLINT

Date Added: 2023-01-16

Author: David Poltorak

Date Actioned: 2023-01-16

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change: Enabled but pass even with error

*Change detail*

PROTOBUF_PROTOLINT generates lots of errors for files which are quite large and may block small changes to these files. Suggest change to enable but pass even with error to not block velocity. Suggest to re enabled when files can be reviewed as a specific task

---

Date Added: 2023-03-27

Author: Pat Losoponkul

Date Actioned: 2023-03-27

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change:  Customise

*Change detail*

Add `.protolintrc.yml` used by `protolint` linter and configure it to disable the following rules
- `REPEATED_FIELD_NAMES_PLURALIZED`
- `ENUM_FIELD_NAMES_PREFIX`
- `ENUM_FIELD_NAMES_ZERO_VALUE_END_WITH`
- `FIELD_NAMES_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE`

These rules should be disabled since they try to rename some fields deviating from the spec submitted to W3C.

Author: David Poltorak

Date Actioned: 2023-01-16

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change: Enabled but pass even with error

*Change detail*

OPENAPI_SPECTRAL generates lots of errors for files which are quite large and have been generated by the openapi generator which is going to be replaced with Tapir in future work.
