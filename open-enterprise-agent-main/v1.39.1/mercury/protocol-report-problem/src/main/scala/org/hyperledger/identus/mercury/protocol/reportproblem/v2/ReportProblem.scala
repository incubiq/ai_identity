  *   human or from some other party or system. Thus, the message constitutes a warning from the sender’s perspective. A
  *   situation with warning semantics might be that a sender is only able to encrypt a message for some of the

  * @param p:
  *   The protocol within which the error occurs (and any co-protocols started by and depended on by the protocol) is
  *   abandoned or reset. In simple two-party request-response protocols, the p reset scope is common and appropriate.
  *   However, if a protocol is complex and long-lived, the p reset scope may be undesirable. Consider a situation where
  *   a protocol helps a person apply for college, and the problem code is e.p.payment-failed. With such a p reset
  *   scope, the entire apply-for-college workflow (collecting letters of recommendation, proving qualifications,
  *   filling out various forms) is abandoned when the payment fails. The p scope is probably too aggressive for such a
  *   situation.
  *
  * @param m:
  *   The error was triggered by the previous message on the thread; the scope is one message. The outcome is that the
  *   problematic message is rejected (has no effect). If the protocol is a chess game, and the problem code is
  *   e.m.invalid-move, then someone’s invalid move is rejected, and it is still their turn.
  *
  * A formal state name from the sender’s state machine in the active protocol. This means the error represented a
  * partial failure of the protocol, but the protocol as a whole is not abandoned. Instead, the sender uses the scope to
  * indicate what state it reverts to. If the protocol is one that helps a person apply for college, and the problem
  * code is e.get-pay-details.payment-failed, then the sender is saying that, because of the error, it is moving back to
  * the get-pay-details state in the larger workflow.

/** Descriptors After the sorter and the scope, problem codes consist of one or more descriptors. These are kebab-case

  * Senders of problem reports SHOULD include at least one descriptor in their problem code, and SHOULD use the most
  * specific descriptor they can. Recipients MAY specialize their reactions to problems in a very granular way, or MAY
  * examine only a prefix of a problem code.
  *
  * The following descriptor tokens are defined. They can be used by themselves, or as prefixes to more specific
  * descriptors. Additional descriptors — particularly more granular ones — may be defined in individual protocols.

/** ReportProblem
  *
  * @see
  *   https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#problem-reports
  *
  * @param pthid
  *   REQUIRED. The value is the thid of the thread in which the problem occurred. (Thus, the problem report begins a
  *   new child thread, of which the triggering context is the parent. The parent context can react immediately to the
  *   problem, or can suspend progress while troubleshooting occurs.)
  *
  * @param ack
  *   OPTIONAL. It SHOULD be included if the problem in question was triggered directly by a preceding message.
  *   (Contrast problems arising from a timeout or a user deciding to cancel a transaction, which can arise independent
  *   of a preceding message. In such cases, ack MAY still be used, but there is no strong recommendation.)
  *
  * @param code
  *   REQUIRED. Deserves a rich explanation; see Problem Codes below.
  *
  * @param comment
  *   OPTIONAL but recommended. Contains human-friendly text describing the problem. If the field is present, the text
  *   MUST be statically associated with code, meaning that each time circumstances trigger a problem with the same
  *   code, the value of comment will be the same. This enables localization and cached lookups, and it has some
  *   cybersecurity benefits. The value of comment supports simple interpolation with args (see next), where args are
  *   referenced as {1}, {2}, and so forth.
  *
  * @param args
  *   OPTIONAL. Contains situation-specific values that are interpolated into the value of comment, providing extra
  *   detail for human readers. Each unique problem code has a definition for the args it takes. In this example,
  *   e.p.xfer.cant-use-endpoint apparently expects two values in args: the first is a URL and the second is a DID.
  *   Missing or null args MUST be replaced with a question mark character (?) during interpolation; extra args MUST be
  *   appended to the main text as comma-separated values.
  *
  * @param escalate_to
  *   OPTIONAL. Provides a URI where additional help on the issue can be received.
