  M2 - Assign DID and VCs to AI
========================================================================================

[ORIGINAL SPEC] OUTPUTS
Open source GitHub repo containing all code and APIs to:
 - assign DID to a virtualised AI (the AI is running in docker and accessible via openseourceais.com) 
 - create a Verified Credential for this AI
 - get general information and stats from this AI, in the form of a JSON format

[ORIGINAL SPEC] ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
 - The AI is assigned a DID
 - The AI has one or multiple Verified Credentials
 - Additional milestone 1 outcomes are satisfied

M2 - NEW PLAN AFTER M1 DESIGN review
    * wrap Identus APIs for our needs in a separate open source "identity" nodeJS app (will likely host it on identity.opensourceais.com)
    * make OSAIS as admin + issuer & verifier of VCs of this identity platform
    * identity open source APIs to issue wallets (to AI, to Caller, to service provider)
    * identity open source APIs to issue DID (to AI, to Caller, to service provider)
    * identity open source APIs to issue VC (to AI, Caller, service provider)
    * OSAIS to decompose an AI's attribute to resurface service providers (of GPU, of models, etc...) [this part is not open source, as part of OSAIS internals]
    * OSAIS to display in UI the status of an AI from its VCs (identity, performance, cost) [I will likely make all open source until getting a JSON, then the UI may be private, to be reviewed]

========================================================================================
  Tasks done during this milestone [May 2024]
========================================================================================

 - built the open source framework of the Identity NodeJS app that connects Identus to OSAIS
 - added ability to register an entity (caller, worker, provider) and assign a DID + create an Identity wallet + create entity's authentication keys into Identus
 - within OSAIS, implemented assigning a DID to all registered users (callers)
 - TODO - change OSAIS to allow uploading a new model into a VAI
 - TODO - change OSAIS to allow uploading a new AI Program into a VAI
 - TODO - change OSAIS to allow uploading a new config file into a VAI
 - TODO - with all those changes, a VAI becomes now a AI wrapper host running on a GPU => it is now a GPU service provider
 - TODO - a AI Prog is also a service provider (program version, etc...) so that it can also receive DID + VCs
 - TODO - issue a DID to the VAI

 - ??? Produced video report ???
